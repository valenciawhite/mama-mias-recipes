    <h2>Bruschetta al Pomodoro</h2>
    <p>Bruschetta al pomodoro is the best way to use up all those ripe summer tomatoes. I love using ripe plum tomatoes
        for this recipe, they are juicy, deep red and full of flavour. A good olive oil is a must and rustic crusty
        bread make all the difference. This classic appetizer will never let you down if you choose the best, highest
        quality ingredients you can get your hands on.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>large slices crusty white bread</li>
        <li>4 large ripe plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 small bunch basil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a hot griddle pan. Drizzle a little olive oil on each side of the bread and toast on each side. Once
            toasted, rub one side of each toast with a clove of garlic.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, chop the tomato into small sized cubes and add to a bowl. Finely chop the basil and add to the
            tomato with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add around 1/2 tbsp of olive oil and mix together.</li>
        <li>Arrange the toasts on a serving plate and top with the chopped tomatoes, serve.</li>
    </ol>
